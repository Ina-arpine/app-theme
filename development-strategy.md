## 1.Using Flexbox grid into semantic HTML

__As coaches, we want to see HTML started with semantic elements with flexbox grid built-in classes without using external style(CSS)__

### Repo

This user story was developed on a branch called `semantic-flexbox`

### HTML

- Add semantic elements such as `<header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer>`.
- Add flexbox `row` class which  is a grid-based layout system `one row separated into 12 columns`
- Add flexbox grid class such as `col-xs-12,col-sm-8, col-md-6, col-lg-4` to make web site responsive for different screen sizes.
- Add alignment property `end` for align item into row to start from the end of the row
- Add alignment property `middle`for align item into row  vertically middle
- Add same rules above to `about, services, and contact pages`

### CSS

- Nothing has added
